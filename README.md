## Adding bootstrap to your app ðŸ‘‡
 
run this in the terminal:
```bash
yarn add bootstrap
```

got to `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` and rename the file to have the extension `.scss` instead of `.css` (we will see more about this on Thursday)

add this line in the `application.scss` file ðŸ‘‡

```scss
@import "bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

### Now you can use bootstrap classes in your app ðŸŽ‰
